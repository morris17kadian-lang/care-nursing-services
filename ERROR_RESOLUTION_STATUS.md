- **Solution:** ✅ Created notification-icon.png from existing CARElogo.png
- **Status:** RESOLVED

### 2. **Duplicate Variable Declarations**

- **Solution:** ✅ Removed old static arrays, kept context-based data
- **Status:** RESOLVED

### 3. **Import Path Errors**

- **Status:** RESOLVED

## ⚠️ **Current Issue:**

### **React $$typeof Error**
- **Problem:** `[TypeError: Cannot read property '$$typeof' of undefined]`
- **Cause:** Indicates an undefined React component being used in JSX
- **Debugging Steps Taken:**
  1. ✅ Commented out ChatNotificationIntegrator
  2. ✅ Temporarily removed AppointmentProvider
  3. ✅ Added ErrorBoundary for better error reporting
  4. ✅ Temporarily disabled notification calls in AppointmentContext

## 🎯 **Next Steps to Resolve $$typeof Error:**

### **Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Circular Dependency between Contexts**
   - AppointmentContext imports NotificationContext
   - NotificationContext might indirectly reference AppointmentContext
   - **Solution:** Remove cross-context dependencies temporarily

2. **Undefined Component Import**
   - One of the imported screens might be exporting undefined
   - **Solution:** Check each screen export systematically

3. **Vector Icons Issue**
   - MaterialCommunityIcons might not be loading properly
   - **Solution:** Test with basic icons only

4. **React Navigation Issue**
   - Navigation components might have undefined references
   - **Solution:** Simplify navigation structure

## 🚀 **Current App State:**
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ No compile-time errors
- ✅ Notification icon asset resolved
- ✅ All import paths fixed
- ❌ Runtime $$typeof error persists

## 📝 **Warnings (Non-blocking):**
- `expo-notifications` Android push notifications removed from Expo Go SDK 53
- Development build recommended for full notification functionality

## 🔄 **Recovery Plan:**
If $$typeof error persists:
1. Gradually re-enable components one by one
2. Start with minimal app structure
3. Add contexts back incrementally
4. Test each addition for the error
